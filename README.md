# Keeper-App
A simple keeper app front end app developed with React and React materials

As part of learning to use React in the a web development bootcamp taken in Udemy. 
I made a simple keeper app to learn about advance feature from javascript like arrow functions, filter, map and reduce
I learned about React Hooks, Forms, Event handling and States.

I found React really powerful and I am thinking to add the Nodejs or Spring backend to make it a complete app
